**Social Media App Simulation â€“ Java**

**Description:**  
This project simulates a social media application using graphs to represent user connections and interactions. Developed in Java, it features a user-friendly interface that allows users to visualize their connections and interactions within the network. The application implements Dijkstra's algorithm to identify strongly connected users, facilitating the discovery of influential connections within the social network. This project highlights the use of graph theory in real-world applications, enhancing understanding of social dynamics and user relationships.

**Features:**
- Graph-based representation of user connections and interactions.
- User interface for visualizing connections and navigating the network.
- Implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm to find strongly connected users.
- Interactive features allowing users to explore their social network.

**Technologies:**
- Java (OOP, data structures)
- Graph theory concepts
- GUI Framework (Swing/JavaFX, specify if applicable)
